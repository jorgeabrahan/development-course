# 📖 Development Course <a name="about-project"></a>

**Development Course** is a project to teach others what I've learned through many years of studying web development and programming. My goal is that by teaching programming basics in the easiest way, everyone understands that they can learn web development and much more.

## ❓ FAQ <a name="faq"></a>

- **What am I going to learn?**

  - Even though this course is mainly focused on web development, you'll learn programming in general and this will help you a lot, not just to create amazing websites, but also applications, games, and basically everything that involves coding. Keep in mind that we will cover JavaScript which is a worldwide used programming language, not just for web pages, but for multiple things like the mentioned before; even NASA used it recently, so even if you're interested in something else than web development this course will be useful for you.

- **Which technologies will this course cover?**

  - It'll cover basic web development technologies for frontend (html, css, and javascript), but also a javascript framework that is absolutely needed for bigger projects (react), and finally a backend language to work the server-side of your wepages (ruby). You will learn to use not only the necessary tools to create amazing websites but also all the processes needed (wireframes, mockups, deployment, client-server infrastructure, and much more) to get to the final product that users need.
